                    If you have already tried to create an account, you probably saw the token input. 
                    Tokens serve as a safety and security measure for our server, preventing crashes caused by excessive registration attempts and allowing us to maintain full control over who receives an account. 
                    Obtaining a token is simple. 
                    You can either get elected after submitting a short application on our Discord server or donate money to the project.
